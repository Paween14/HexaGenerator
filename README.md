# HexaGenerator

This hexaGenerator is created by using pure Javascript(mainly focused on DOM manipulation for the purpose of practicing working directly with DOM), HTML and CSS. The user can choose the amount of randomly generated hexa colour codes. Otherwise, five hexa colors are generated by default. In addition, pause and reset functions are included.
